# Beginner Java Projects

Welcome to **Beginner Java Projects**, a curated collection of Java programs developed as part of my foundational journey in software engineering. This repository includes structured mini-projects and exercises that demonstrate core Java concepts such as control flow, functions, data types, classes, conditionals, loops, and simple I/O operations.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repository serves two main goals:

1. **Learning by Doing**: Reinforce beginner-level Java syntax, logic-building, and programming best practices.
2. **Code Portfolio**: Maintain a structured record of my progress in Java programming.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- Input/Output using `Scanner`
- Variables, data types, and expressions
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Functions and return values
- Class structures and object-oriented design (beginner-level)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each project is located in its own subfolder and includes the source `.java` files along with input/output descriptions and (if applicable) sample runs.
